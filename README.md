What's going on
---------------
Non-destructive imaging methods preserve tissue integrity, leading to improved topography analysis, which are critical in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). Our approach utilizes an immunofluorescence (IF) assay for measuring the colocalization of proteins and structures through staining of human post-mortem tissue to access and quantify neuron populations. This paper briefly discusses neuro-positive IF biomarkers and U-Net as part of a segmentation algorithms to detect blobs.
